Course Description for Nick
===========================

I will be working on developing the knoatom website for immediate use during the Fall '13 semseter in EECS 203 and EECS 280.  I am also working on preparing the website to scale up to wider use.  I am working on the "course web protal" part of the site which will provide a mechanism for instructers and students to efficiently share and submit resources associated with different "Knowledge Atoms" (specific topics).  The resources will include lecture notes, videos, key examples and will list them by ranking.  It will also provide a forum with intelligent ranking and search capabilities for students questions.

I will be evaluated through weekely meetings with my faculty director and the other students working on the project to discuss progress.  I will also keep a development log describing my progress.  While working on this project I will use the general programming skills that I developed in EECS 280.  I will meet with my faculty director approximately weekely.  The completion of my project will be determined by the performance of the "course web portal" side of the website.  When this part site is ready for EECS 203 and EECS 280 Fall '13 semester the project will be complete.
