<!--

The only reason I have this file is because I want to have consistency
in the context variables of files when you use them as templates.

Also because in the future we might want to make the base home view
different than the class home view.

Note:  There shouldn't be anything in here that is also in "class/index.html", everything that is in both should be in "shared/index.html"
